            <h2 class="section-two__title">About me</h2>
            <p class="section-two__desc"> MS Dhoni led India to three ICC titles but he is nearly as famous for his
                exploits in the yellow of Chennai Super
                Kings in the Indian Premier League.Dhoni, known as CSK's "Thala" (leader), captained the franchise to
                ten finals in
                their first 14 IPL seasons and won them five titles - in 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 . He's led them
                to the
                playoffs in 12 editions, making them the most consistent team in the IPL. In a surprise move on the eve
                of the IPL
                2024 season opener, Dhoni stepped down as CSK captain and was succeeded by Ruturaj Gaikwad.
                Dhoni was bought by CSK at the first IPL auction in 2008 and - barring a handful of games in 2022 - has
                been their
                captain ever since. No other player has led an IPL team for so long. Only when CSK was banned for two
                years on
                corruption charges - in 2016 and 2017 - did Dhoni play for another team in the IPL: Rising Pune Super
                Giant(s).
                Dhoni's most memorable season with the bat was 2018, when he scored 455 runs at an average of 75.83 and
                strike rate
                of 150.66 to lead CSK to the title in their comeback season following the ban.
                Dhoni was the first to play 250 matches in the IPL, reaching the milestone in 2023, four years after he
                played his
                last international game for India. .</p>
